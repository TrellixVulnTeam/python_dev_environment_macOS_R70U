## Python 2.7 development environment ( MacOS 10.15.7 - Catalina )

This environment contains all the sorces required to program and run core python2.7 programs. 
Since all source code are included ( Python2.7.9, setuptool etc ) there is no need to install any external dependency.
The idea behind this dev-env is for quick porting between different systems in your team.
